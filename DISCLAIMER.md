# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (quan hệ luật sư-khách hàng)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (luật sư), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Vietnam Bar Federation (Liên đoàn Luật sư Việt Nam) and local bar associations (Đoàn Luật sư) must comply with the Law on Lawyers (Luật Luật sư) and the Code of Professional Ethics and Conduct of Vietnamese Lawyers when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking official sources (Công báo, Cổng Thông tin Điện tử Chính phủ, LuatVietnam at luatvietnam.vn)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (còn hiệu lực) and has not been amended (sửa đổi) or repealed (bãi bỏ/hết hiệu lực)
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting guiding documents (văn bản hướng dẫn), resolutions of the Judicial Council of the Supreme People's Court, and relevant case law (án lệ)
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Vietnamese legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases (Công báo, Cổng Thông tin Điện tử Chính phủ)** | Authoritative | Statute text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources (LuatVietnam)** | Supplementary | Legal summaries, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **International treaty databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations metadata |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- LuatVietnam (Premium), THƯ VIỆN PHÁP LUẬT (thuvienphapluat.vn), VietLaw

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations, and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Vietnamese law changes continuously through new legislation (luật, pháp lệnh, nghị định, thông tư), amendments, and court guidance
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the Công báo
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position (tình trạng hiệu lực)

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" (còn hiệu lực) may have been:
  - Amended (sửa đổi, bổ sung) after the last database update
  - Repealed (bãi bỏ/hết hiệu lực) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional provisions (quy định chuyển tiếp) affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law (án lệ)** -- Coverage is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research from the Supreme People's Court (Tòa án nhân dân tối cao)
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording (các phiên bản trước)
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of National Assembly debates (Quốc hội) and drafting materials
6. **Sub-national legislation** -- Coverage of provincial/municipal (tỉnh/thành phố) People's Council decisions and People's Committee directives may be incomplete

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary and guiding documents, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Sub-National Law Blind Spots**: Vietnam's multi-level legislative system means local regulations may be missed
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess international treaty obligations or compliance

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees
